Problem: Bratu equation cube domain 1D, 2D, 3D, 4D, 5D & Bratu equation ball domain.

This page provides the code and results associated with the research paper titled "A finite difference method with symmetry properties for the high-dimensional Bratu equation". The computations presented in the paper were originally performed on a computer with an Intel Core i5 10400 processor and 64 GB of RAM. If you have a high-performance computer, you can use the code to obtain better bifurcation diagrams and more precise first turning points.

In general, there are four main files for running the code:
- main1.m (1D, 2D, 3D): solves the Bratu equation for a single value of lambda or C,
- main2.m: constructs bifurcation diagrams,
- main3.m: identifies the first turning point, and
- main4.m: plots the results.

If there is an error in the code, please send an email to shahab@its.ac.id.
